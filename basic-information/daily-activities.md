# Daily Activities

Idolmaster 2 has more of a strategy component to it than the origin. Let's polish our scheduling strategy and raise our idols!

## Lessons

This time around there are three kinds of lesson: Vocal, Dance and Visual. By holding a lesson in one of these, you can raise the corresponding statistic. By raising your idols' statistics, the unit's Image Level will rise.

Just like before, raising two statistics at the same time is not possible, so systematically raising the parameters becomes the key to raising your idols.

For more information, refer to [Lessons](lessons).

## Work

This is work outside of stage performances. It is an important alternative that allows you to raise your Memory Level. Also, the time cost is 2 slots, so it is possible to schedule work along with a normal lesson or shopping. By raising your Memory Appeal count you can greatly expand your options on stage, so from the start of the game, proactively holding work and lessons to build up power for use in the second half of the game is a good idea.

### Promotion

Promotion is work which does not have an associated monetary cost.

You can acquire an **increase in Attention Rate in that area + a reasonable increase in fan count + money + Memory**. You cannot expect the same raise in Attention Rate which would be obtained from Paid Promotion (which will be mentioned later), but reliably acquiring money is its forte. Generally speaking, money is necessary in the initial stages of play, so promotion can be a particularly helpful option.

### Publicity

Publicity (also known as Paid Promotion) is work which _does_ have a monetary cost.

You can acquire a **huge increase in Attention Rate in that area + a large fan count increase + Memory**. In exchange for expending a large sum of money, you can earn a large Attention Rate and fan count increase, making publicity a powerful choice. On top of earning a fan count increase equivalent to success on stage, you can increase Memory, and on top of that, you can hold a lesson on the same week, making this an extremely high efficiency option, so if you manage to build up a good surplus of funds, you should proactively go for this kind of work.

It is also an effective means of raising the Attention Rate in areas where it has greatly fallen.

## Auditions

An Audition is a stage performance which does not have a monetary cost.

There are two kinds of audition, Area Auditions and National Auditions. Area Auditions allow acquiring **a large increase in that area's Attention Rate + a standard fan count increase + a fee for performing**, and National Auditions allow acquiring **a slight increase in all areas' Attention Rates + a standard fan count increase + a fee for performing**.

Of particular importance, National Auditions are important for extending sale of CDs. **Fan count Ã— Attention Rate**, along with the high score for the song, has an important place in CD sales. Therefore, the time of releasing a new song is when you want to proactively go for auditions.

By fulfilling the particular conditions, you can trigger a Revival.

## Lives

A Live is a stage performance which does have a monetary cost.

You can acquire **an increase in that area's Attention Rate + a standard fan count increase + a fee for performing**. It is easier to get a higher score than at a Festival, so it is good to hold a Live to aim for a high score. The area Attention Rate is relatively easier to raise, so you want to aim for this if you have the time.

By fulfilling the particular conditions, you can trigger a Keep. In addition, at a Quintet Live a Keep will not occur, but by fulfilling the particular conditions, you can trigger a Super Break.

In the case of a Quintet Live, If you don't raise your intimacy rate with characters you are not producing, in some cases the guests will not show up, so be careful with that. If the guests don't show up to a Quintet Live, the unit status can suffer as a result.

## Festivals

A Festival is a stage performance which does not have a monetary cost.

You can acquire **an increase in that area's Attention Rate + a standard fan count increase a fee for performing**. Unlike other stage performances, it is a **battle with a rival**, and **high scores are hard to get**.

The stage where tactics and strategy become the most important, how to use the Memory and Burst becomes the key to victory. The main game's event battles are based around Festivals, so you will want to get used to them quickly.

By fulfilling the particular conditions, you can trigger a Break.

## Shopping

It is possible to buy clothes and accessories.

Of course you're going to need money, so drop by when you have some. There are various kinds of costume ranging in cost from a few thousand to nearly a million.

Money carries over between games, so when aiming to buy expensive items, you can play a round where you primarily aim to get more funds.
