This page was created for the purpose of gathering information.  To some extent, the aim is to determine the accuracy of information and organise it.

Black text is information which was released before sale, red text is information from threads, comments and the like.

This page covers points where the PS3 version has changed from the Xbox 360 version.

If you notice anything, aren't sure, think something needs further investigation or anything else, please leave a comment. \[translator: In our case, it might just mean that the page is out of date.]

However, please refrain from commenting on the game itself or requesting information.

### Additional Difficulty Selection

Difficulty NORMAL (compared to the Xbox 360 version)

- Leaving lessons and stage performances to the idols is enabled from the very first week.
- Adjusted balance for winning the IA Grand Prix (conditions themselves have not changed.)
- The Utahime-Utaōji Festival, along with the VESPERIA Festival, are no longer possible to leave to the idols.
- Each individual item for the producer evaluation stops at A at the highest point (cannot get an S.)

Difficulty HYPER (compared to NORMAL)

- During the end-game, Festivals appear where you can battle against Ryuugu Komachi with their new song "七彩ボタン" and costume "プリンセスメロディ♪".
- Leaving lessons to the idols becomes possible after clearing Hyper once.
- Leaving stage performances to the idols becomes impossible.
- Right from the start, high difficulty stages appear (resulting in money and fans becoming easier to acquire.)
- The money and fan count you can acquire from doing jobs increases.
- Clearing unlocks special accessories.
- The fan count threshold for the Utahime-Utaōji Festival to appear is increased to 150,000.
- Sales numbers required to level up your rank are increased.

### Stage For You!

- You can watch the Jupiter trio and solo on stage.
- Available stages are gradually unlocked by clearing certain Auditions, Lives or Festivals.
- Improving on the stages in the Xbox 360 version, stages which you can use for a Quintet have increased by 4 for a total of 8.
- **※ There are reports that even if you complete all 34 stages in the Xbox 360 version, the total you can use for a Quintet is only 7.**

### Dotop TV

- The scrolling rankings can be stopped by pressing Start, and can be scrolled in any direction using the directional buttons.
- Even if they are still scrolling, hitting {% icon button-circle %} ({% icon button-cross %} on a Japanese PS3) will immediately close the screen.
  (**TODO: Fix the button references here, Google Sites broke it at some point, and the Japanese page link is no longer correct.**)
- When Ryuugu Komachi's and Jupiter's current songs are on the ranking, the scrolling will stop briefly before continuing again.

### Costume Options

- You can use the Street Hopper (ストリートホッパー) (a costume found in the Xbox 360 DLC) as lesson clothes, even if you haven't obtained it. Yet, in the Xbox 360 version, it still cannot be used for this.
- You can use The Best Schoolmate (ザベストスクールメイト) (a costume fount in the Xbox 360 DLC) as school clothes, even if you haven't obtained it yet.

### Songs

- Additional songs, "READY!!" and "七彩ボタン"
- Songs from the Xbox 360 DLC, "Little Match Girl", "Honey Heartbeat", "愛 LIKE ハンバーガー" are included from the start.

### Costumes

- Additional costume, Ryuugu Komachi's costume, Princess Melody (プリンセスメロディ♪)
- Additional costume for use with Jupiter in S4U! mode, Weiß Jupiter (ヴァイスジュピター).
- Additional DLC costumes up to volume 3 of the Xbox 360 Catalog, available as long as you fulfil the conditions.
- Floral costume, Snow Strawberry NEO (スノーストロベリーNEO) is replaced with The Wild Strawberry (ザ☆ワイルドストロベリー).
- To unlock the Beyond the Stars (ビヨンドザスターズ) costume you must produce Miki, Hibiki and Takane as leaders, not just one of them.

### Accessories

- Xbox 360 DLC accessories, Happy Earmuffs (ハッピーイヤーマフ), Burger Badge (バーガーバッジ), Chemical Light Bangle (ケミカルライトバングル) are available from the early stages.
- However, they have been weakened to the level of other starting accessories.
- Accessories from up to volume 3 of the Xbox 360 Catalog as well, are available as long as you fulfil the conditions.
- Hand accessory, Pink no Pompom (ピンクのポンポン)  is replaced by Ghost Puppet (ゴーストパペット).
- Together with the above changes, Pacman (パックマン), Dot Ichigo Seal (ドットイチゴシール), Ghost Puppet (ゴーストパペット) and Pacman Boots (パックマンブーツ) are treated as a set.

- There is now a dedicated screen for purchasing them.

### Stage Performances

- When you don't pass / fail / get defeated it is possible to retry the Audition / Live / Festival.
