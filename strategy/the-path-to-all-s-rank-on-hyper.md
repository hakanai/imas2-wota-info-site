# The Path to All S Rank on Hyper

A rough strategy for beating the PS3 version at Hyper difficulty with all S ranks and getting the true end.

Sauce: http://www44.atwiki.jp/idolmasterim2/pages/104.html

## Conditions to Get S Rank

(This wasn’t on the original page but I find it useful for information’s sake)

| Idol Image Level | LV16 |
| High Score | 65,000 |
| Total Song Sales | 5,500,000 (or more?) |
| Highest Chart Position | 1 |
| Retries | 0 |
| IA Awards | All awards<br><br>(Win the Utahime-Utaōji Festival in each area after getting 150,000 fans in the respective area.  The main award you will automatically get if the above conditions are met.) |

## Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Skill |
| Funds | Allow for at least 300,000 |
| Amulets | Sugamo (スガモ), Awanko (あわんこ), Ringamo (リンガモ), Nikuwan (にくワン)<br>Aside from Sugamo, match with your specialisation |
| Costumes | If possible, a complete set (best to have clothes with high power) |
| Accessories | High point items (hoshi or mikazuki series,  white cat, etc.) |
| Lessons | Perfect lessons are the absolute minimum requirement but getting the bonus is better. |
| Important Point | This strategy does not rely on reporters, but if you get one, consider it lucky. |
| Important Point 2 | Ignoring the fan count in the Capital Area is assumed. |

## From preparing your 1st song up to selecting your 2nd

Recommended reporters: Koshiba(小柴), Yamahara(山原), Ariake(有明)

| Target activity period | Weeks 1 to 10 |
| Number of days where you get a choice | 6 |
| Compulsory events | Week 1<br>Week 2<br>Week 3<br>Week 10: RISING MOON Festival (vs Ryuugu Komachi) |

### Model Schedule

| Timing | Activity to carry out | Remarks |
|--------|-----------------------|---------|
| Week 1 | \*Normal Business + Vocal Lesson | Leader Selection |
| Week 2 | \*Super Dance Lesson + Visual Lesson | Member Selection |
| Week 3 | \*THE DEBUT National Audition | 1st Song Selection |
| Week 4 |  |  |
| Week 5 |  |  |
| Week 6 | National Audition | 1st Song Release |
| Week 7 |  |  |
| Week 8 |  |  |
| Week 9 |  |  |
| Week 10 | \*RISING MOON Festival (vs Ryuugu Komachi) |  |

- First of all, put together your unit.  Bursts scores are low at the start, so choose a song with high BPM.
- Score doesn’t matter at the first audition.
- After the first audition, Paid Promotion + Lesson for two weeks.  On release week (week 6), go for a National Audition (difficulty 8 or above.)
- Try to get 32,500 points or above at this audition to put the song in the top 50 in the second week of release (week 7.)
- After this, spend the rest of the time until selecting the 2nd release repeating Paid Promotion + Lesson.
- On week 10 you battle Ryuugu Komachi and lose.  After this the atmosphere is a bit strained but don’t worry because (unlike the Xbox version) when the next comes, everyone is back to normal.

## From preparing your 2nd song up to selecting your 3rd

Recommended reporters: Koshiba(小柴), Yamahara(山原), Ariake(有明)

| Target activity period | Weeks 11 to 18 |
| Number of days where you get a choice | 8 |
| Compulsory events | None |

### Model Schedule

| Timing | Activity to carry out | Remarks |
|--------|-----------------------|---------|
| Week 11 | Paid Promotion + Lesson | 2nd Song Selection |
| Week 12 | Paid Promotion + Lesson |  |
| Week 13 | Paid Promotion + Lesson |  |
| Week 14 | National Audition | 2nd Song Release |
| Week 15 | Live | Aim for a Keep |
| Week 16 |  |  |
| Week 17 |  |  |
| Week 18 |  | (afterwards)<br>After Communication with the leader (story-related) 1 |

- Immediately announce your new song on week 11
- It doesn’t make much difference from the above schedule but if you see reporter Koshiba(小柴) then it might be good to take an audition or other event in his area.
- If it doesn’t look like he’s going to come, do a Paid Promotion + Lesson for 3 weeks and on release week, take a National Audition (consider it lucky if there is a reporter there.)
- After the release, continue to repeat Paid Promotion + Lessons.
- If you’re aiming to get your 2nd song into the top 20, a high score of 47,000 or above will apparently ensure this.
- If that score seems impossible for you, go for a Live the next week and try for a high score of 43,000 or above.
- Aim for a Keep.  If you get it, the song will enter the top 20 on the 3rd week of release.
- Even if it doesn’t, don’t worry. Let’s put our hopes on the 3rd release.

## From preparing your 3rd song up to selecting your 4th

Recommended reporters: Yamahara(山原), Ariake(有明), Ataka(安宅)

| Target activity period | Weeks 19 to 26 |
| Number of days where you get a choice | 7 |
| Compulsory events | Week 21: FUJISAN ROCK Festival (vs Ryuugu Komachi) |

### Model Schedule

| Timing | Activity to carry out | Remarks |
|--------|-----------------------|---------|
| Week 19 |  | 3rd Song Selection |
| Week 20 | National Audition |  |
| Week 21 | *FUJISAN ROCK Festival (vs Ryuugu Komachi) Central Area | (afterwards)<br>After Communication with the leader (story-related) 2 |
| Week 22 | National Audition | 3rd Song Release |
| Week 23 | Live | Aim for a Keep |
| Week 24 | Live | Aim for a Keep |
| Week 25 |  | (afterwards)<br>Ritsuko comes to talk with you. No After Communication. |
| Week 26 |  |  |

- If your 2nd single did not make the top 20, from here you will move to get into the top 20.
- Go with a personal song of one of your idols.
- Proactively go for festivals or auditions (etc.) which will greatly increase the fan numbers.
- In order to increase sales, it is a good idea to take a National Audition 2 weeks before release (making it two in a row.)
- A week after the release, aim for a Keep by going to a Live (somewhere other than the Capital Area.)
- Once you enter the top 20, start with Paid Promotion + Lesson.
- In Hyper difficulty, Paid Promotion gives you over 40,000 fans so it is highly recommended.

## From preparing your 4th song up to selecting your 5th

Recommended reporters: Yamahara(山原), Ariake(有明), Ataka(安宅)

| Target activity period | Weeks 27 to 34 |
| Number of days where you get a choice | 7 |
| Compulsory events | Week 32: ODYSSEY Festival (vs Amagase Touma) |

### Model Schedule

| Timing | Activity to carry out | Remarks |
|--------|-----------------------|---------|
| Week 27 |  | 4th Song Selection |
| Week 28 |  |  |
| Week 29 |  |  |
| Week 30 | National Audition | 4th Song Release |
| Week 31 |  |  |
| Week 32 | *ODYSSEY Festival (vs Amagase Touma) West Area |  |
| Week 33 |  |  |
| Week 34 |  |  |

- From here on, devote yourself solely to increasing the fan count.
- Of course, go with a personal song of one of your idols again here.
- Taking jobs which add 40,000 or more fans makes this easier.
- If you’re aiming for a Super Break, holding a Quintet Live is good, but difficult.  Quintet Lives with a large fan increase have a difficulty of 11 to 12.  If you can get a high score of over 50,000 then by all means, challenge some.
- On release week, take a National Audition.  On the week after, hold a Live.
- If you get reporter Ataka(安宅) and win a Festival using Sugamo equipment, fan numbers will greatly increase.
- At this point in time there will be areas with a fan count over 150,000, and if reporter Ataka(安宅) is present, take the Utahime-Utaōji Festival.

## From preparing your 5th song up to Idol Academy

- Now we make a move to get over 150,000 fans in all areas except the Capital Area.
- When you arrive at this point, don’t forget to take Utahime-Utaōji Festivals
- Most likely, assuming you don’t get a Super Break, at this point Jupiter or Ryuugu Komachi’s new song will be taking up 1st and 2nd positions on the chart.
- If you do well, even after beating all Utahime-Utaōji Festivals there will still be 7 weeks remaining.
- Aim for 1st place sales (Most likely, even if you achieve a Keep, if you don’t reach about 1,900,000 sales you won’t make it.)
- As for lessons, get your Image Level to 16.
- Next, 10 weeks after your 5th release, in order to get a Break, challenge Festivals.
- It is recommended to do this in an area where reporters Yamahara(山原) or Ataka(安宅) are present.
- It might be good to go for a Revival of your 4th song, but Ryuugu Komachi’s total sales are 2,900,000 so there is a chance you won’t make it.  (Ryuugu Komachi’s new song comes out on week 45 so if you do the Revival in weeks 43-44, you can get to number 1 before them.)
- If the 5th song gets a Break you will easily exceed 4,000,000 sales and easily get number 1.
- It may be trouble, but if it hadn’t made it by week 52 there isn’t enough time, so in that case, reload the game.
- Week 52 is the showdown with Jupiter so up until week 53, keep doing Auditions and Lives and the like, and aim for a high score of 65,000.  To get an S Rank in Hyper difficulty you need a high score of over 65,000, so don’t forget this.
- The type of player who plays Hyper difficulty can get quite a high score so if you have already made it, feel free to do lessons (consider it preparation for when there will not be any time to take any)
- If you’ve come this far, Jupiter will be small fry, so even without using Sugamo you should be able to win easily.  But to be absolutely sure you won’t lose, use Sugamo.
- With this, after accepting all awards at IA, the Producer Assessment will be All S Rank

## Summing Up

- In the end, this is just one way to do it. I’m sure there are many other ways.  Take this guide to be just one method.
- Finally, I will append my own data at time of getting the All S using this method:
    - Idols: Leader Chihaya, Takane, Hibiki
    - Image Level: 16
    - Total Song Sales: 8,600,774
    - Top Sales for Single Song: 4,426,627
    - High Score: 72,236 Pts
    - Retries: 0
    - Division Awards, IA Awards: All Won
- Convenient to remember:
    - Week 10 - 1st Festival with Ryuugu Komachi
    - Week 21 - 2nd Festival with Ryuugu Komachi
    - Week 32 - Festival with Touma
    - Week 41 - IA Nomination Event
    - Week 54 - Festival with Jupiter
    - Week 55 - IA Grand Finale
