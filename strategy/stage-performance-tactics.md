# Stage Performance Tactics

This time around you will be playing three kinds of stage performance: Auditions, Lives and Festivals.

Because the advice for how to beat them is still changing, you should just playing it by ear.

## About the Different Appeals

There are three types of appeal: General, Memory and Burst Appeal.

Depending on how you use and time their usage, your score can change greatly.

### General Appeal

Each time you appeal, the rate for the ability which you appeal will decrease and the rate for the ability of the circle immediately to the right will increase.

**Dance Appeal → Visual recovers**

**Visual Appeal → Vocal recovers**

**Vocal Appeal → Dance recovers**

It's a kind of circular relationship.

By using this, one arrives at a method where, in the start, you appeal only two abilities and then aim for a high multiplier on the remaining ability.

You can even start a burst appeal at the very last appeal in the song, so you should take this into account when aiming for a high score.

### Memory Appeal

This time around, using a memory appeal can set all rates to a fixed value as well as increasing the burst gauge.

At a Festival, it also has the effect of decreasing your opponent's burst gauge, so the point at which you use it becomes crucial.

### Memory Drive

As a prerequisite, you need a memory level of 3 or above.

If you use a memory appeal with member A and then switch to member B (using L1) and have them do a consecutive memory appeal, you can perform a duo appeal.

After that, if you then switch to member C (using L1 again) and use another memory appeal, you can perform a trio appeal.

By doing this, voltage can be hugely increased.

By the way, if during all this you throw in a burst appeal as well, you can perform a duo or trio appeal.

Example: Perform a memory appeal with Member A → perform a memory appeal with member B (duo) → perform burst appeal → perform a memory appeal with member C (trio).

### Burst Appeal

When the burst gauge reaches maximum, if you press R1, you will perform a burst appeal.

In this situation, the displayed buttons are fixed for each character, and are biased towards some ability standing out above average.

If you care about the multipliers, pressing L1 to switch characters before doing it is less wasteful.

Also, even if the opportunity to do the burst appeal appears if you wait a while without pressing R1, you will return to normal appeals.  By the way, while the display remains in the centre of the screen, even if you do nothing, you will still get score.  With this, it becomes a period in which you can choose to start a burst, so there is some benefit if you burst at the moment the song finishes.

For the timing at which appeals end for each song, please refer to the [List of Songs](/reference/list-of-songs/).

The number of appeals during a burst appeal is lower for low BPM songs (for my song, -1).

The rate after a burst completes is 0.70 + (burst success count × 0.10).

Consequently, if you make a miss during a burst, aside from the obvious decrease in score, your rate will also be lower.

### Changing the Appeal Character

By changing the character, you can create a change in the memory appeal or burst appeal score.

If you make good use of this you can expect much higher scores, so it is useful when aiming for a high score.

But actually, depending on the amulet you're holding, it becomes less necessary to change the character.

### Chain Bonus

It goes without saying, but you get more score if you get a Perfect for every beat.  If you get a Good, you only get 1/6 of the score of a Perfect and if you get a Bad, you will receive an extreme deduction in score.

However, this is not limited to the deduction in score from getting Good or Bad beats themselves, this will often also reduce your chain bonus.

With the chain bonus, from a 2-Chain onwards, you receive a bonus of (chain count + 5) points.

Just hearing this, you might think that even if you get a 100-Chain it's only 105 points, not much at all.  Actually, when you add it up, it becomes quite a big score.

The maximum chain when you get All-Perfect is based on the song's appeal count itself, but of course, depending on your use of memory or burst  appeals, it can change, but as an example, consider the maximum chain count to be 150. (This is the largest appeal count of the songs available in the early stages.)

If you get an All-Perfect, your total chain bonus will be:

<div style="margin-left: 4em;">
7 + 8 + 9 + ... + 153 + 154 + 155 = 12,069
</div>

On the other hand, if right in the middle of the song, you miss a beat just once and end up with a 75-Chain and 75-Chain:

<div style="margin-left: 4em;">
75-Chain : 7 + ... + 80 = 3,219 <br>
74-Chain : 7 + ... + 79 = 3,139 <br>
3,219 + 3,139 = 6,358
</div>

Even with just a single miss, you end up losing 6,000 points.

Missing a single beat at the start or end of the song makes this loss of score much smaller.

At the announcement of results when appeals end, the total chain bonus is also shown, so consider checking it.

If by any chance, for a song where you should be able to get a 150-Chain, the bonus is only around 8,000, then if you get All-Perfect, the score could perhaps be extended by another 4,000 points or so.  This can become an approximation of the high score.

By the way, if you want to know the chain bonus for an All-Perfect, you could just compute this the slow way by adding up 7 + 8 + ... but you could also use the following equation:

<div style="margin-left: 4em;">
(maximum chain count + 11) × maximum chain count  ÷ 2 - 6
</div>

## Audition Guide

Auditions, a regular of the series.

You will aim for the passing margin and earn the pre-determined score.

### Tactics

In the description for the audition, there are times when they are "looking for a ~~~ image" (～のイメージが欲しい) but this only affects the interest rate at the start of the audition and the change in the rate when performing appeals.

For example, at auditions which say they are looking for a strong vocal image, the interest rate for vocal will be higher at the start.

So it simply means that **the displayed image is easier for earning points - it has absolutely no effect on passing the audition.**

Whether you pass or not is **purely a matter of score.**

This means that you should have no problem passing auditions which desire a vocal image, even with zero vocal appeal.

## Live Guide

Lives are a stage performance where the goal is to bring the crowd up to the specified level of excitement (the game calls this ハコユレ震度).

The level basically starts at -2.0 and has you reach, for instance, +2.0.

### Tactics

The level is related to your score, so somehow or other you have to get a high score.

Because of this, how much you can appeal without missing any beats becomes the key.

Anyway, as long as you don't get a Bad, the level will gradually increase, so missing the timing is the one thing you shouldn't do.

However, in the case of high level lives, if you don't proactively go for the full combo, there are times when you won't reach the displayed value.

Unlike auditions though, you're immediately out if you don't reach the minimum value, so the number one thing you should think about is how to appeal to aim for the high score.

Also, in the case where you don't have a high enough level right near the end of the song, using a burst right at the end is an effective way to increase it.

## Festival Guide

Festivals seem to be the stage performance which requires the greatest amount of strategy.

Paying attention to your opponents and figuring out the best way to get more score than them is the essence.

### Tactics

Festivals how to prevent your opponent from using a burst appeal is the key.

Watching your opponent's burst gauge, if it seems like they can get from where they are to max before you can, use a memory appeal to chip away at their gauge.

Whenever possible, the most important thing is to get a head-start at a chance for a burst.

Also, it is good to bring in an amulet to help you out during the battle.

There are many amulets with effects specialised for festivals so bringing an amulet to match your objective makes things much easier.

However, just like you, because the opponent will also use memory appeals, there are times when they will be chipping away at your own voltage gauge.

At this point is it fine to perform your own memory appeals in return, but beware of the number of memory appeals running out.

### Example Tactic

**Sealing your opponent's movement by battering them with burst appeals**

Equipping the Sugamo-chan amulet (スガモちゃんお守り) with the effect of a huge increase in voltage for general appeals, you will keep earning more voltage.

If you also fire burst appeals as often as you can, you will reliably be able to use your burst appeal and the result of that is that you can decrease the opponent's burst appeal count.

However, due to the "burst score down" effect, you can't hope for much score, so this strategy is exclusively useful for winning at festivals.
