# List of Stage Performances

This is a list of stage performance jobs (Auditions, Lives, Festivals) by rank.

Stage performances and so forth with special conditions which occur due to events in the game are listed separately under "Special Stage Activities". Aside from those, of the state activities which occur under normal conditions, the much rarer "National Auditions" alone have their names recorded for each audition. For activities which fall outside of those, several activities have the same kind of numbers attached, so they are grouped by difficulty level.

The characteristics of each kind of stage performance can be found under their respective entry in [Basic Information](/basic-information/daily-activities). For a concrete guide on how to win stage performances, refer to [Stage Performance Tactics](/strategy/stage-performance-tactics).

## How to read each entry

Title
: In the case of National Auditions as well as special stage activities, the name of the audition. For others, the name of the activity type is used as-is.
: Once an audition has been dealt with once, an item with the same name and conditions will not appear a second time.
: In particular, the overall number of National Auditions is quite small, so they should be used systematically.

Difficulty Level
: The difficulty level of the stage activity.
: This is based on the information displayed in-game, but basically, the higher the difficulty level for an activity is, the harder it will be.

Cost
: The cost required in order to hold a Live. For other kinds of activity, the cost is 0.

Paid
: The remuneration you are paid for holding an activity.
: However, for Auditions, because the money is received only if you appear on TV, if you don't succeed at the audition, you won't receive any pay.

Fan Increase
: The number of fans you will get by succeeding at the activity. Based on information displayed in-game.
: In the case of National Auditions, it is the total increase nationally, with the increase per-area recorded in parentheses (split 6 ways.)
: In the case of other stage activities, the recorded fan increase occurs only the area in which you held the activity.

Passing Line
: The passing line required in order to succeed at the stage activity.
: However, in the case of Festivals, due to the specific way they work, a specific numeric value cannot be attached.
: Also, inside parentheses (xxx pts), the points required to reach the passing line are sometimes recorded as well.
: However, of concern here is that the editors are still confirming the values here by seeing it for themselves, so even if you clear that score 100%, there is no guarantee that you will pass. In the end, it should be used as a reference.

Stage Name
: Displays the name of the stage as shown when choosing a stage in S4U.

Remarks
: Records and specific conditions or details about the appearance or participation in the activity.
