# Table of Idol Grouping Reactions

When you get to choose the second and third members, everyone has a different reaction to the leader.

The following symbols will be used to represent this:

Good feeling ◎ 

Ordinary ◯ 

Difficult ×

**In addition, this data just collects all the reactions in one place.  In reality, it is thought that the unit members don't really have any particular compatibility with each other.**

The table shows, when the idol on the left is the leader, how the idols along the top will react to her.
