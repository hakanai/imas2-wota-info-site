# Janken

When you play Janken (rock paper scissors, for people with less exposure to Japanese culture) with an idol, their facial expression generally gives away what they are going to throw.

By the way, **this change in expression occurs immediately before the selection choices appear**. Also, as you would probably have found out fairly early on, the aim of the game is to lose.

Some people say, "I can't remember all three expressions!" But three draws in a row is also acceptable, so really you only need to remember one facial expression.

For instance, if you only remember their "rock" face, then if they make that face, throw "scissors". If they make any other face, throw "paper", and you will either lose or draw.
