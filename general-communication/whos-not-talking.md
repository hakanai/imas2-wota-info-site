# Who's Not Talking?

"Dare ga inakunatta deshou?"

Recording ways to distinguish the idols' voices.

| Idol               | Characteristics |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Haruka** (春香)  | Voice is always one step behind the other characters. |
| **Miki** (美希)    | A high voice. The final "shou" is not emphasised.  Difficult to distinguish if she and Mami are in the same unit. |
| **Chihaya** (千早) | A very calm and gentle voice, pitch dropping right at the end of "deshou". |
| **Yayoi** (やよい) | There is a "reru~" sound to her speech. (TL note: It seems our friends at the Wikia couldn't come up with a way to translate this either.) Can be difficult to distinguish if she and Miki, Mami or Hibiki are in the same unit. |
| **Yukiho** (雪歩)  | Compared to other characters, her voice is weaker and lower volume. |
| **Makoto** (真)    | Enunciates the line quite clearly.  Her "da" is particularly distinctive. |
| **Mami** (真美)    | A high voice. Not quite to the extent of Hibiki, but the final "shou" is louder. Difficult to distinguish if she and Miki are in the same unit. |
| **Takane** (貴音)  | Speaks slightly faster than Chihaya and her voice is slightly higher on the whole. |
| **Hibiki** (響)    | The final "shou" is spoken super loudly at the end of the line. |
