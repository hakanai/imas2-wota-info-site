## Beginner's Guide

For your first play-through, rather than suddenly aiming for a high rank, it's probably better to play however you like.

In THE IDOLM@STER2, there are times when you will be asked to play using various combined strategic elements.

The guides on the site which aim to get you a high rank are **written under the assumption that you already understand how to construct an efficient schedule and can complete mini-games with good results**.

At a minimum, in order to grasp why certain factors are regarded as important, as well as to get used to the various mini-games, you should try to play through freely for about 1-2 play-throughs. By doing this you will also attain the required funds to obtain clothes, amulets and the like.

## Simplified Chart by Week

This is a simplified chart for use as a guide.

Compulsory events are marked with ○, events which occur based on certain conditions are marked with △.

Songs are marked assuming you take the earliest option to announce the song.  The numbers indicate the release number, and the symbols preceding the numbers:

- An attached "-" marks the preparatory period.
- Numbers without a "-" mark the weeks following release where the sales coefficient will not yet be zero.
- An attached "!" marks the week the release goes on sale.
